Electric vehicles are getting better and
more popular every year,
They are quiet, have no emissions
and the cost to charge them is just the
low price of electricity.
According to a KPMG survey, The
next new vehicle purchase for nearly
70% of Canadians will be an electric
model.
Transport Canada has even set targets
to have 10% of all light-duty vehicles
be electric by 2025, 30% by 2030 and
100% by 2040.
As the market keeps growing there is a
huge gap that will need to be filled.
The most expensive part of an EV is the battery
but it doesn't last forever.
According to EDF Energy,
Most manufacturers have a five to eight-year
warranty on their battery.
However, the current prediction is that an electric car battery will last from 10 – 20 years before
they need to be replaced.
We know how expensive electric vehicles are to
maintain since the only op􀀃on is to return to
the manufacturer for parts and service.
Service, Parts and
end of life.
The increasing number of electric
vehicles will create an electronic waste problem
because of the difficulty involved in the disposal of the
battery pack.
Perfectly salvageable EVs will end up in the
scrapyards all over Canada and the United States.
This is an opportunity that we can capitalise on.
Starkly upscale is creating an online marketplace
to keep good EV parts and batteries out of
junkyards and on the road as long as possible.
Where those with the supply of these parts
(Scrapyards, auto body shops, resellers etc.)can
access the growing demand (EV owners, service
centres, recyclers etc.).
Serving service centres with salvaged parts and
also Upcycling EV batteries at end of life.

this sector who could be competition.
